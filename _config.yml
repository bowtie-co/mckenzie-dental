description: McKenzie Dental was founded in 1974 by the McKenzie family and it was the first dental practice established in Welches. A new office building was constructed in 1997 that was custom built to be a comfortable and inviting place for dental care. Dr. Robert Kelly and the team at McKenzie Dental are proud to offer a warm and caring environment where we strive to treat everyone like family. We listen to understand each personâ€™s values and needs to tailor optimal, individual care. We are also proud to offer the best treatment available for family, cosmetic, and implant dentistry.
