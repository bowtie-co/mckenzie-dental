Angela  has  been  with  McKenzie  Dental  since  2005  and  soon  after  fell  in  love  with  the  community  and  beautiful  mountain  setting.  Angela  entered  the  field  in  1996  as  a  dental  assistant  until  she  was  accepted  into  the  dental  hygiene  program  in  2003.  As  a  hygienist,  she  is  constantly  striving  to  improve  her  skills  and  learn  new  technologies  to  benefit  her  patients.  Angela's  love  of  animals  prompted  her  to  start  McKenzie  Dental's  Annual  Pet  Food  Drive,  which  benefits  local  needy  pets.  She  enjoys  reading,  camping,  photography,  exploring  Portland  as  well  as  knitting  and  bee  keeping.  Most  of  all,  she  enjoys  spending  time  with  her  family,  husband  Chris  and  son  Holden.
