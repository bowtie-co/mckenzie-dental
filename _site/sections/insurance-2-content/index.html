  <p><strong>Insurance</strong></p>
  <p>As a benefit to our patients, our financial coordinator will work with you to help ensure you are using your insurance to its maximum benefit. We work with all our patients to develop treatment plans that will work with your budget. We will gladly submit a pre-treatment estimate to your insurance company so that you will know what your benefits will be. Our practice accepts most dental insurance programs, including non-managed care, indemnity (traditional) and PPO out-of-network.</p>

  <p><strong>Payment Options</strong></p>
  <p>Dental services are to be paid at each appointment with cash, check, credit card, or dental financing we have available. As a courtesy, we will bill your insurance directly for services provided. Estimated co-payments and deductibles not covered by your insurance carrier are requested at the time of service. When more extensive dental care is necessary, financial arrangements can be made with our office.</p>

  <p><strong>Insurance</strong></p>
  <p>McKenzie Dental offers a credit program through a third-party agency, CareCredit. CareCredit is a no, to low, interest credit card which provides a flexible payment plan and can be used for a variety of other health care services. More information is available at <a href="http://www.CareCredit.com" target="_blank">CareCredit.com</a> or by stopping by our office to pick up a brochure.</p>
